<p align="center">
   I'm Hazem from Sweden, and I do content on Design and Development. I really enjoy learning languages and frameworks like React and React Native, as well as work    in Back-end like node.js and database like mongoDB. I also enjoy wireframing, ui, ux, and design in general.

```js
import Developer from 'shhm8905';

class Bio extends Front-end Developer {
  name     = 'Hazem Khaleel';
  title    = 'Front-end Developer';
  location = 'Sweden';
}

class Skills extends SoftwareDeveloper {
  languages  = ['JavaScript', 'Html','Css'];
  databases  = 'MongoDB';
  frameworks = ['React', 'React Native'];
}
```
